<H2>What is NaTour?</H2>
NaTour is a complex and distributed system aimed at offering a modern social network to hiking lovers. The system consists of a secure, high-performance and scalable back-end (built with Spring Boot and cloud-based technologies) and a mobile client (Android) through which users can take advantage of the system's features in an intuitive, fast and pleasant way.
